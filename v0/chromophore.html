Chromophore-binding pocket. The unique photochromicity of phytochromes results from key interactions between the bilin
and its binding pocket (1,6,22). Biliverdin slides into a crevice formed between a6 and a7 on one side and the GAF b-sheet on
the other, largely burying the extended bilin within the protein (Figs 1b, 3c and 4a). The PAS domain and upstream
sequence provide little direct contact except for residues immediately surrounding the ligating Cys 24.

<b>Photochromism</b> is the reversible transformation of a chemical species between two forms by the
absorption of electromagnetic radiation (photoisomerization), where the two forms have different
absorption spectra. In plain language, this can be described as a reversible change of colour upon
exposure to light.  Popular reference: photochromic eyeglass lens.

Consistent with previous binding studies with bilin analogues in plant phytochromes, the propionic-acid side chains of
the B and C rings are particularly important for positioning biliverdin. These sidechains penetrate deeply within the
cleft between a7 and b-strands 9 and 10, and are fixed by highly conserved charge interactions, direct and
water-mediated hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 3c). In particular, the carbonyl oxygens of the B-ring
propionate form salt bridges with the amines of Arg 254 and form hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl group of Tyr 216 and
main-chain nitrogen of Ser 257, whereas the C-ring propionate oxygens hydrogen-bond to His 260 and the hydroxyl groups
of Ser 272 and Ser 274. A water molecule (Wat 18) forms a water-mediated bridge between the C-ring propionate and His
290. There are also van der Waals interactions between Ile 29 and the aliphatic carbons of the B-ring propionate.

Other interactions contribute to biliverdin orientation in the pocket. Asp 207, Ile 208 and Pro 209 (the DIP motif)
create a kink in the polypeptide chain betweenb8 and a6, allowing these residues access to the chromophore (Fig. 3c). The
side chain of Asp 207 forms a hydrogen bond with its own main-chain nitrogen to stabilize this proline-induced kink, and
forms a bifurcated hydrogen bond to the nitrogens of the A and B rings. There are hydrophobic interactions between Ile 208
and the C ring, between Pro 209 and the C10 carbon that links the B and C rings and between Pro 209 and the B ring. His
260, which was previously shown to be critical for biliverdin conjugation to DrBphP forms hydrogen bonds with the
pyrrole nitrogens of rings B and C and its planar shape helps to fill a van der Waals sandwich between these planar rings
and Leu 264. Wat 12 mediates a remarkable hydrogen-bonding network from His 260Nd1 to the pyrrole nitrogens of biliverdin
rings A, B and C (Fig. 3c). During phototransformation from Pr to Pfr, a substantial re-orientation of ring D is
expected 22,26. A notable feature in our model of DrCBD is the relatively sparse packing of side chains around the D ring to
allow this rotation. Hydrophobic residues Met 174, Val 186and Leu 286 line the pocket but are not tightly packed against
the Dring. The main contacts to the D ring are polar on one edge (a hydrogen bond from the ring carbonyl to His 290N12)
and hydro-phobic on the other (Tyr 176, Tyr 263, Phe 198 and Phe 203) (Fig. 3b).Although Tyr 176 is buried under the
chromophore in our Pr structure, the latter three aromatic residues are partially solvent-exposed, and the phenylalanine
side chains contact the D-ring vinylgroup

<h4> Insights into the Pr to Pfr photochemistry</h4>

The crystal structure of DrCBD provides insight into the uniquered/far-red photochromicity of phytochromes. There is
general agreement, based on spectroscopic results, that phototransformationto Pfr in plant and bacterial phytochromes
involves a 15Zanti to 15Eanti isomerization of the C15¼16 double bond (Fig. 3a)20,22,27,28.  Space around the D ring would
allow rotation relative to the other pyrrole rings during the Pr to Pfr phototransformation with minimal interference from
amino acids lining the pocket and only the clash of eclipsing methyl carbons from the C and D rings of the
chromophore limiting rotation angle in either direction (Fig. 3c). Pre-existing torsional strain on the Pr D ring may
serve to reduce the activation energy for rotation. The C15¼C16 isomerization would dissolve the interaction of the D
ring with its Pr bonding partner His 290 and might perturb Phe 198 and Phe 203 by removing favourable van derWaals
interactions.

In addition to rapid isomerization of the C15¼C16 bond, a subset of published experiments have predicted a
torsion angle rotation from the 15Eanti to the 15Esyn configuration at the C14–C15 bond (20,22,27,28). However, recent elegant
studies with chemically locked biliverdin analogues demonstrated that the locked 15Eanti conformer of biliverdin
covalently associates with a bacterialphytochrome and exhibits spectral properties similar to the Pfrform28.

If this further 15Eantito 15Esynmovement does occur, it would cause a steric clash between the D ring and Tyr 176 (if
the rotation is away from the solvent) or Tyr 263 (if the rotation is towards the solvent). A continued rotation to the
15Esyn position could also lead to a clash with the side chain of Asp 207 (Fig. 3c). The rotation(s) of biliverdin lead to
a partial decoupling of the pconjugation system and a red-shift in the absorption spectrum of phytochrome that is
characteristic of the Pfr conformer(29). Presumably, such movement(s) induce additional conformational changes in the
polypeptide to generate the distinctive shape of the Pfr conformer, which for many fungal and prokaryotic
phytochromes affects the activity of an appended kinase domain (1,4).

For plant phytochromes Pfr formation exposes a nuclear localization signal in a downstream PAS-related domain (30) or
uncovers interaction motifs for downstream effectors (31). It is also possible that C15¼C16 bond isomerization could
lead to perturbation of the solvent-exposed Phe side chains and that further torsion about C14–C15 could push Asp 207 and
initiate local melting of the DIP motif on the surface of the CBD. Either of these would lead to a change in the shape
and properties of the invariant surface patchat the chromophore-binding site (Fig. 4a). A final intriguing possibility
is that even slight shifts of the orientation of B and C rings within the pocket as a consequence of D-ring movement
and postulated pocket structure changes could release the propionate side chains from their electrostatic
interactions. This release could break the structural bridge connecting the GAF and PAS domains and thereby free the PAS
domain for signal transmission (Fig. 2a).  Clearly, determining the structure of the Pfr form of CBD and of DrBphP with an
intact PHY domain downstream of the CBD will be essential to further understanding phototransformation and
signal transduction by phytochromes, given the importance of the PHY domain to the establishment and maintenance of Pfr.

<h4> Functional and evolutionary implications</h4>

An important feature of the DrCBD structure with respect to the rest of the phytochrome superfamily is the high degree of
conservation (4,32) of essential residues that form the PAS and GAF domains, bind thebilin, and create the trefoil knot
(Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 2). Specific examples include the Asp-Ile-Pro (DIP) motif at the bilin-binding pocket, polar
residues that interact with biliverdin propionic-acid groups (Arg 254, Ser 272 and Ser 274), bulky hydrophobic residues
that line the D-ring cavity (Phe 198, Phe 203, Tyr 176 and Tyr 263), and residues that form the hydrophobic core of the
trefoil knot (Ile 35, Leu 41, Leu 241 and Leu 253). For example, recent work has highlighted the importance of Tyr 176 in
the photochemistry of Synechocystis Cph (1) by showing that a His substitution at this position destabilizes Pfr and creates
a red fluorophore (33). Consequently,we expect that our structure of this bacterial phytochrome will behighly relevant to
most, if not all, members of the phytochrome superfamily.

Conservation of residues surrounding the knot, including the invariant presence of the lasso loop within the GAF domain,
indicates that this unique topology is common to all red/far-red photochromic phytochromes. In fact, only the loosely
defined collection of bacterial phytochrome-like proteins may lack this fold, an idea based on sequence alignments that
show that this group lacks both the PAS domain and the GAF loop4. Although several members of this phytochrome-like group
bind bilinsin vitro (RcaE, CikA andTaxD1/PixJ1) (34–36) the resulting holoproteins are not red/far-red photoreversible,
suggesting that the knot is required for this spectral characteristic. Within the holoprotein, the knot may have several
functions. One may be to stabilize contacts betweenthe PAS and GAF domains. Another may be to limit the flexibility of a
photoreceptor as a mechanism to prevent undesirable energylosses due to vibration or large domain movement upon
photo-isomerization of biliverdin. Finally, by severely restricting movement of the N-terminal domain, the knot may
orient Cys 24 for efficientc onjugation to biliverdin.

How do phytochromes fold into this convoluted tertiary structure? We propose a simple co-translational mechanism in which
the PAS domain folds first, leaving the N-terminal 35 amino acids unstructured and Ile 35 solvent-exposed. As translation
continues, the first half of the GAF domain, comprising the a4–a5 helical hairpin, the b6,b7,b8 half-sheet and a6, is
translated and adopts its secondary structure.b9 is synthesized, followed by the lasso loop.  The exposed hydrophobic side
chains within the lasso collapse around Ile 35 to form the compact knot core. Finally, the second half of the GAF domain
is translated. Although the internal symmetry of the GAF domain is interrupted by the lasso (Fig. 1a, c), the first and
last b-strands cannot zip together in the centre of the sheet until translation is complete.

With respect to the evolution of this photoreceptor class, our model may explain in molecular terms how phytochromes
changed from proteobacterial photoreceptors using biliverdin as the chromophore to those present today in cyanobacteria
and plants that use the more reduced bilins, PCB and PFB, respectively (Fig. 3a) (1,26). Presumably, these blue-shifted
bilins offer an adaptive advantage for sensing photosynthetic competition by closely matching the absorption spectrum of
chlorophyll (3,4). This switch required evolution of mechanisms to synthesize reduced bilins and to discriminate them
from biliverdin in the lyase active site (Fig. 3a). Cyanobacterial and plant phytochromes use a cysteine in the GAF
domain to bind theA-ring C3 ethylidene side chain of PCB/PFB (37,38), as opposed to the proteobacterial and (probably)
fungal phytochromes that use acysteine upstream of the PAS domain to bind the C3 vinyl sidechain of
biliverdin (4,11,32). Remarkably, modelling of this GAF cysteine into its comparable position (Met259) in DrCBD reveals that
it would extend towards the C3 side chain, as does Cys24 in DrCBD, but from the opposite side of the chromophore
(Fig. 4b). With no adjustment to the surrounding structure, the sulphur atom of acysteine replacement at position 259
would be 5.8 Å from the Cys 24 sulphur and only 3.2 Å from the target C31 carbon of the bilin. Consequently, evolutionary
transformation of the bilin attachment site could occur without structural changes, simply by acquiring a cysteine at the
appropriate position in the GAF domain. In support, ref. 32 recently showed that an Agrobacterium tumefaciens BphP1 (Agp1)
variant in which the distal cysteine was added (Val249!Cys) preferentially assembles with PCB versus biliverd into
generate a photochromic phytochrome with typical red/far-red absorption spectra.  The structure of the bilin-binding domain
of DrBphP yields the first three-dimensional insights into the photochemistry and evolution of the phytochrome
superfamily. This structure provides molecular explanations for the known physico-chemical features of phytochromes, for
Pr to Pfr photoconversion events that initiate responses of behavioural and agricultural significance, and for
the evolution of the phytochrome family.
