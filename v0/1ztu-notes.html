Phytochromes are red/far-red light photoreceptors that direct photosensory responses across the bacterial, fungal and
plant kingdoms. These include photosynthetic potential and pigmentation in bacteria as well as chloroplast development
and photomorphogenesis in plants. Phytochromes consist of an amino-terminal region that covalently binds a single bilin
chromophore, followed by a carboxy-terminal dimerization domain that often transmits the light signal through a
histidine kinase relay. Here we describe the three-dimensional structure of the chromophore-binding domain of
Deinococcus radiodurans phytochrome assembled with its chromophore biliverdin in the Pr ground state. Our model, refined
to 2.5 A ̊ resolution, reaffirms Cys 24 as the chromophore attachment site, locates key amino acids that form a
solvent-shielded bilin-binding pocket, and reveals an unusually formed deep trefoil knot that stabilizes this
region. The structure provides the first three-dimensional glimpse into the photochromic behaviour of these
photoreceptors and helps to explain the evolution of higher plant phytochromes from prokaryotic precursors.

Prokaryotes and eukaryotes employ a complex array of photoreceptors to coordinate their response to the ambient light
environment. One of the most influential is the phytochrome superfamily, a large and diverse group of photoreceptors
that use a bilin (or linear tetrapyrrole) chromophore for light detection. These photoreceptors bind bilins via a
thioether linkage to a cysteine within the polypeptide, using an intrinsic lyase activity. After assembly, phytochromes
sense red and far-red light through two relatively stable conformers, a red-light-absorbing Pr form and a
far-red-light-absorbing Pfr form. By photoconverting between active and inactive forms, phytochromes act as
light-regulated master switches in numerous signalling cascades. Phytochrome photoreceptors were first discovered in
higher plants because of their ability to initiate red/far-red photoresponses of agricultural significance such as seed
germination and flowering. More recently, they have been found in cyanobacteria, proteobacteria, actinobacteria,fungi
and slime moulds. Despite their importance, we still do notfully understand the initial molecular events that allow
phytochromes to switch reversibly between the Pr and Pfr forms, nor how this transition is transduced to appropriate
sensory cascades. In an attempt to define how phytochromes work at the atomic level, wehave solved the three-dimensional
structure of the light-sensingregion of a phytochrome from the bacteriumDeinococcus radiodurans complexed with its
native chromophore, biliverdin.
