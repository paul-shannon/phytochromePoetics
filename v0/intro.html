<h4> The Structure of a Plant Photosensory Module</h4>

    Plants are exquisitely sensitive to light.  They use the information thus acquired to decide
    <ul>
      <li> when to germinate, leaf and flower
      <li> where, when and how to grow
    </ul>

    "Knowledge" and "decide" are terms we most commonly use to describe animal - and especially
    human - cognitive capabilities.  I use these terms here intentionally - to
    highlight the common ground shared by plants and animals, by oak and human, microbe, and (our
    focus here) the mouse-eared cress.

    <p> We usually see an immense gulf between humans and other living creatures.  We could also
    attend to the complexities and capabilities found in all organisms.

   <p> This project argues for seeing things that way, for the "anti-narcissism of continuous variation"
     (Eduardo Viveiros de Castro).   The big differences are uncontested.  The continuous variation
     and similarities are also worthy of our attention.

   <p><p>I take <b>cognitive</b> to describe processes in which
      <ol>
	<li> information is collected from the environment
	<li> that information is weighed, trade-offs calculated, resulting in
	<li> adaptive behavior
      </ol>

    <p>This web application explores the first of these steps: the collection of information from
      the environment.  Fifty years of evolving technique produced in 2014 the first
      molecular structure of a plant phytochrome holoprotein - a complex amino acid
      structure with a red light sensitive molecule tucked inside.  (Full attributions
      available in the <b>Papers</b> tab.  The molecule presented here is PhyB from
      Arabidopsis thaliana (mouse-ear cress), crystallography and model construction
      by Richard Vierstra's lab at the University of Wisconsin.

    <p> My projec is indebted to that lab, to the research community to which
      it belongs, and to an entire swarm and history of talented software engineers: to many at RStudio for
      shiny, to Alex Rose and colleaues for ngl, to uncounted others who write and maintain 
      the many layers and pieces of inter-operating open source software upon which we all depend.

    <p> The webapp opens with a selective view of the light-responsive circular pyrrole
      nestled inside a hairpin of the Phy domain of the PhyB molecule (as pictured above).
      Buttons to the  left in the molecular display toggle the visibility of many parts of the structure.
      (I will be adding more substructures and ligands soon.)
      Mouse actions zoom, pan and rotate the model.
